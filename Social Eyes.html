                <p class="project-desc">For AR glasses, the main and mature use case is enterprise AR (e.g. training or manufacturing), but <strong>social interaction is still an empty space</strong>. So we looked through all papers from 1997 till now which published on Ubicomp and ISWC conferences. And after the first round of <strong>literature review and user research</strong>, we narrowed down the context to networking events. And after the second round of research, we dove deeper to identify user needs and summarize design principles.</p>

                    <p class="project-desc">Social conversation is highly dynamic compared to preset information in the  enterprise. As contextual information will be provided directly in front of our eyes, it’s easy to distract people from normal conversations.</p><br>


                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">Why we chose networking event? - Privacy</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Privacy is a big concern for social interactions. One insight from the user research is that ‘people often feel uncomfortable if someone browses their profile in front of them’. Compared to a casual party, the networking context is the one people are more willing to share their personal information and need access to more information.</p>

On the contrary, the <strong>2nd</strong> option <strong>requires more cognitive effort</strong>. But currently there’s already <strong>several technologies available</strong>: triangulation, RFID, or ultrasound beacons. So finally we decide to provide the 2nd option.

                <p class="project-desc"><strong>How to seamlessly transit between multiple devices, such as from AR to mobile and back?</strong></p>
                    <p class="project-desc">"I didn’t see the option (on the glass) from one person’s profile to add an outline on the phone" (P2) There’s transfer cognition from glass to mobile. Users lack awareness of mobile usage when they are using AR glasses. </p><br><br>

                <p class="project-desc"><strong>How would social behavior change when everyone has AR access to everyone’s profiles?</strong></p>
                    <p class="project-desc">"Knowing he knows something about me may change our flow of conversation." (P2)</p><br><br>

                <p class="project-desc"><strong>How to help users understand the hierarchy within wearable devices?</strong></p>
                    <p class="project-desc">"I’m not sure filter is in the exploration mode". "I don’t think the direction is inside" (P1, P2, P3, P4) Not only for AR glasses, for other devices with small screens like smartwatch, users all need more context information of where they are and what interactions offered on the page like clicking.</p><br><br>

                <h2 class="page-header bT">WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
                <hr>
                <p class="project-desc"><strong>How to balance between technical constraint and design capability?</strong></p>
                    <p class="project-desc">As our target is to design the present use and future use of AR devices under social contexts, we need to consider technical alternatives. It’s a hard decision for any envision projects, of whether to consider the technical constraints or not.</p><br><br>

                <p class="project-desc"><strong>Hardware interaction design instead of pure interface design</strong></p>
                    <p class="project-desc">Unlike mobile or web design, which mature design guidelines exist, the amount of work done in this space is not as extensive, especially for wearable AR. We thought thoroughly about the hardware interaction design. It’s challenging, we had about 30+ debates during our design phases, but at the same time, definitely interesting!</p><br><br>

                <p class="project-desc"><strong>Different process for hardware envisioning projects.</strong></p>
                    <p class="project-desc">For envision projects, user research is not so useful at the beginning. Instead, the literature review can provide many insights into what research area has been done and findings from that. So we went through ALL Ubicomp and ISWC papers from 1997 - now (50+) and summarized great insights. From that, we conducted user research to verify our hypothesis and user needs. Another main difference is the design process. Instead of trying to push limits for one iteration, quickly design and iterate are needed.</p><br><br><br><br>

                <p class="project-desc"><strong>In the end, great thanks to our mentor, <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thad-starner" target="_blank">Thad Starner</a>, who served as an inspiration for this project and provided us with a plethora of ideas and feedback in our weekly meetings. Also, I want to thank my 3 awesome teammates - we collaborated really well and conducted all the plans, research and design together which leads to the awesome deliverables!</strong></p>
