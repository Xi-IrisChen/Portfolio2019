                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">BACKGROUND</h3> 
                    <p class="project-desc">There are 450 organizations in Georgia Tech. <strong>Most students will only explore new student organizations at the activity fair</strong>, which is a huge gathering for all student organizations at the beginning of the semester. And <strong>many students may join a lot of organizations at the beginning, but only 1-2 left in the end,</strong> whether because they forget events or the organization is not active not all.<br>

                        <br>For proposing experience, about 20-30 students will attempt to propose a student organization each semester. But only about 5-10 get approved. <strong>The process of proposing is really complicated. And it always comes to problems like hard to find an advisor or similar organizations already exist</strong>...</p><br><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">DESIGN OUTCOME</h3> 
                    <p class="project-desc">Both app and website are provided to combine the online and offline (activity fair) experience. The key features are as below:</p>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">INTERVIEW</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">As the user group were new students who want to join or propose a student organization, I started by a <strong>semi-structured interview</strong> for my classmates who had related experience before. The objective for the interview mainly including:<br>
                        - What’s their motivation for joining?<br>
                        - How to find the organization they’re interested in?<br><br>

                        <strong>I recruited 6 people who all had joining experience before. However, only one student had proposing experience. When I tried to reach out to other students, I still found few students had related proposing experience.</strong> Even they had, they had vague impression and could not remember details. So I decided to look for some help at the Students Center for Student Engagement (which was responsible for managing student organizaiton in Georgia Tech) and conducted a <strong>stakeholder interview with associates dean </strong>finally.</p>
                        <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/research.png"><br><br><br>


                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">'BROWSE', 'SEARCH' EXPERIENCE</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">For total there are 450+ organizations. Students mainly have <strong>4 ways to discover student organizations</strong>. <strong>Almost everyone join by the activity fair.</strong> Also a lot join the organization later by the friend’s recommendation. <strong>However, only a minority of people will browse the website before going to the activity fair.</strong> The main reason including they think it's too much and unnecessary, or some users don't know there is a website at all.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_browse1.png"><br><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">WHAT'S WRONG WITH 'BROWSE', 'SEARCH'?</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">From the research, mainly pain points lie in 'website browse' and 'activity fair'. The user flow and each pain points are as below:</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_browse22.png" data-action="zoom"><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_browse2.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">‘PROPOSE’ EXPERIENCE</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Students attempt to propose about 20 -30 orgnizations each semester. But finally about 5 - 10 get approved. Students get suspended either because the process is too long or the repetitive organizations.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_propose.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">WHAT INFOMRATION DO USERS CARE?</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">For browsing experience, one important factor is what information we want to provide to users. So in order not to conduct a second round of interview or survey, I asked users to rank information they care in the interview. The results are categorized to the following primary and secondary factors. Amony these,<strong>'event' information</strong> especially latest event and its content are what users especially care.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_info.png"><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">PERSONAS</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Finally I built the personas which includes main frustrations for each groups of users. For the next stage of design, I looked back a lot to make sure it could solve their frustrations.</p>

                <hr>
                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">WHAT METHOD TO JOIN?</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">For the browsing experience, the current platform is mainly offline (activity fair). Although a small group of people will use website to browse first. So which could provide a better experience? Online (website or app) or offline (activity fair)?</p>
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Can we only have online experience?</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/offline.png">

                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Then can we only have offline experience?</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/online.png">

                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">So, can we combine the offline and online experience? The advantage of this is:</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/online and offline.png"><br><br><br><br>

                    <p class="project-desc">For the <strong>proposing experience</strong>, as summarized in the research, the current method is mainly manually. Students need to go to the Student Engagement to set up a portal first. The portal is a website version, but right now the platform for users to understand what the process looks like and to submit materials are separate. So it's better to integrate those information to one platform.<br><br>
                    Then which platform to use? As users need to fill out a lot of information when proposing, and sometimes need to go back again to refill it. <strong>Website instead of app is more suitable here.</strong> </p> 
                        <br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">REFINED EXPERIENCE</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">So from the previous analyze, <strong>the activity fair should still be our focus.</strong> But we could use online platform (app) to optimize their offline experience. So different stages of the refined experience are categorized based on the activity fair, and their targets are:</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/target.png"><br><br><br><br>

            </div>


            <div id="design">
                <h2 class="page-header bT">DESIGN</h2>
                <hr>
                    <p class="project-desc">For the design session, I sticked the key research findings on a whiteboard like current and refined experience and design target (as shown below). I want to make sure all my design aligns with users needs and solve their real problems. </p>
                    <img style = "width:50%" src="assets/img/google/whiteboard.jpeg" data-action="zoom"><br><br>
                    <p class="project-desc">And also from the previous analyze, browsing and searching will mostly happens on the app, while website provide a better proposing experience. In order to make it consistent, design should be provided for both platforms. <strong>However because of time constraints, and app covered mainly usage for browsing and searching, I focused on the app design. But a basic version of website was also provided.</strong></p><br><br>
                
                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">SKETCHING</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">So I started sketching! As our target was to utilize app to optimize the activity fair's experience. I started from the pain points of the activity fair and proposing experience, and designed the corresponding features to solve challenges, with keeping in mind the targets for each steps.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/wireframe.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br><br>


                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">DESIGN ITERATION 1</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Right now the design covers the activity fair experience. But if it mainly designed for the activity fair, although it has other functions like managing all events and organizations, I felt it was hard for students to find a strong motivation to open it later. So students may only use it once. </p>
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">So can we apply this not only for the campus fair but also for daily usage?</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="project-desc"><strong>I looked back to research. One feedback is that 'Most users will join a lot at the beginning but forget to join the events later'.</strong> It inspired me that one step is actually missing here. </p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/iteration1.png"><br><br>
                    
                    <p class="project-desc">If users can explore some events to join in their daily life, it could help them to join some regular events. Moreover, even some organization that they have not joined before at the activity fair, they could still explore those here. Let the app becomes a way to discover school events! So I focused on the <strong>'event'</strong> and made the following refinements:</p>
                    <h4 class="mini-title">Change 1: Reconsider the navigation bar</h4>
                        <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/iteration1_1.png" data-action="zoom"><br>
                    <h4 class="mini-title">Change 2: To suit more to daily life, focusing on events.</h4>

                        <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/iteration1_3.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br><br>




               <!-- <h3 class="overview_subtitle">NAVIGATION BAR</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">As the main target is activity fair, <strong>one tab 'explore' is specifically designed for the activity fair</strong>, which including let users quickly browse and keep track of interested organizations. <strong>Another tab 'saved' is mainly for managing all organizations.</strong> Apart from this, the most important needs from the research is 'event' information. That's why in the 'saved' tab, users also can manage all events they gonna join.<br></p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/navigation bar1.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br>
                    
                    <p class="project-desc">As organization has 'explore' and 'manage', but for events, it only has 'manage'. It inspires me to think: do we need 'explore event' or not? Actually it is especially useful for the daily usage.
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">So can we apply this not only for the campus fair but also for daily usage?</span>
                    </p>

                    <p class="project-desc"><strong>I looked back to research. One feedback is that 'Most users will join a lot at the beginning but forget to join the events later'.</strong> Exploring events can perfectly solve this pain point. Users can explore some events to join. Even some organization that they have not joined yet. <strong>So it came to the second alternative: design for daily life but it should support the activity fair.</strong>.</p><br>

                    <p class="project-desc">When deciding the visual style of the system, I kept in mind of the target user (new student) and the context (campus) and drew the mood board and summarized two keywords - youthful and modern.<br><br>

                    <p class="project-desc">Because of the time constraints, <strong>I only drew the hifi of browsing and exploring experience on the app.</strong> The website version and proposing experience on the app are shown with the low fidelity design below.</p>

                    <h3 class="overview_subtitle">Cross-Platform Adaptation</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">The proposed experience is cross-platform, in which browsing and searching mostly happens on the app, while website provide a better proposing experience. But due to the time constraints, I mainly focus on the app design and website proposing design. More details of website design should be considered later.</p>

                    <h3 class="overview_subtitle">Further Cooperation with Student Engagement</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">For the proposing experience, although I’ve tried to optimize it to make it shorter, it still needs to negotiate with Student Engagement later, like revising the proposal and presenting to the committee. So it’s still the first step! More deeper research can be conducted with Student Engagement together to optimize the whole proposing flow.</p>

                    <h3 class="overview_subtitle">Task-based Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Due to the time constraints, I only conducted 3 feedback session to walk them through. But I didn’t have time to evaluate it using task-based usability testing. Iteration never ends!</p><br><br><br><br><br>

                    <p class="project-desc">Wowwww! You made it! Thanks for reading through all the process patiently! Actually this is my first design challenge. At first, I was kind of frustrated. Solve part of the problem but unable to polish it to perfection feels really bad! But later when I try to think broader and broader: from mainly focusing on website / app, to integrating the online and offline experience, to applying it not only for activity fair but for daily usage. I realize every problem could find its potential! We just need to think bold with keeping in mind every step has intentional decision making. However, I still feel there is a lot of things for me to improve. Mostly when I faced with a challenge, one idea always come to mind. But if I have time, I should provide more design alternatives, even for some small details. Anyway, improving never ends! Thanks again and hope to hear from your feedback :)</p><br><br><br>
