                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">BACKGROUND</h3> 
                    <p class="project-desc">There are 450 organizations In Georgia Tech. <strong>Most students will only explore new student organizations at the activity fair</strong>, which is a huge gathering for all student organizations at the beginning of the semester. And <strong>many students may join a lot of organizations at the beginning, but only left 1-2 in the end.</strong> Whether because they forget it or the organization is not active not all.<br>

                        <br>For proposing experience, about 20-30 students will attempt to propose a student organization. But only about 5-10 students get approved. <strong>The process of proposing is really complicated. And it always comes to problem like hard to find an advisor or similar organizations already exist</strong>...</p><br><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">DESIGN OUTCOME</h3> 
                    <p class="project-desc">Combine the online and offline browsing experience. And let users keep track of interested events. The key features are as below:</p>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">PROCESS</h3>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">INTERVIEW</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">As the user group is new students who want to join or propose a student organization, I started by a <strong>semi-structured interview</strong> for my classmates who had related experience before. The objective for the interview mainly including:<br>
                        - What’s their motivation for joining?<br>
                        - How to find the organization they’re interested in?<br><br>

                        <strong>I recruited 6 people who all had joining experience before. However, only one student had proposing experience. When I tried to reach out to other students, I still found few students had related experience.</strong> Even they had, they had vague impression and cannot remember the details. So I decided to look for some help at the Students Center for Student Engagement (which was responsible for managing student organizaiton in Georgia Tech) and conducted a <strong>stakeholder interview</strong> with associates dean finally.</p>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">'BROWSE', 'SEARCH' EXPERIENCE</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">For total there are 450+ organizations. Students mainly have <strong>4 ways to discover student organization</strong>. <strong>Almost everyone participated in the activity fair.</strong> Also a lot joined the organization later by friend’s recommendation. <strong>However, only a minority of people will browse the website before going to the activity fair.</strong> The mainly reason including they think it's too much and unnecessary, or some users don't know there is a website at all.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_browse1.png"><br><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">WHAT'S WRONG WITH 'BROWSE', 'SEARCH'?</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">From the research, mainly pain points lie in 'website browse' and 'activity fair'. The user flow and each pain points is as below:</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_browse22.png" data-action="zoom"><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_browse2.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">‘PROPOSE’ EXPERIENCE</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Students attempt to propose about 20 -30 orgnizations each semester. But finally about 5 - 10 got approved. Students got suspended either because the process is too long or the repetitive organizations.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_propose.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">WHAT INFOMRATION DO USERS CARE?</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">For browsing experience, one important factor is what information we want to provide to users. So in order not to conduct a second round of interview or survey, I asked users to rank information they care in the interview. The results can be categorized to the following primary and secondary factors. Amony these,<strong>'event' information</strong> especially latest event and its content are what users especially care.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/analyze_info.png"><br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">PERSONAS</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Finally I built the personas which includes main frustrations for each groups of users. For the next stage of design, I looked back a lot to make sure it could solve their frustrations.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/personas1.png">
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/personas2.png"><br><br>

                <h2 class="page-header bT">IDEATION</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">WHAT METHOD TO JOIN?</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">For the browsing experience, the current platform is mainly offline (activity fair). Although a small group of people will use website to browse first. So which could provide the best experience? Online (website or app) or offline (activity fair)?</p>
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Can we only have online experience?</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/offline.png">

                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Then can we only have offline experience?</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/online.png">

                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">So, can we combine the offline and online experience? The advantage of this is:</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/online and offline.png"><br><br><br><br>

                    <p class="project-desc">For the <strong>proposing experience</strong>, as summarized in the research, the current method is mainly manually. Students need to go to the student engagement to set up a portal first. The portal is a website version, but right now users can understand what the process looks like and submitting materials are separate platform. So it's better integrate those information to one platform.<br><br>
                    Then which platform to use? As users need to fill out a lot of information when proposing, and sometimes need to go back again to refill it. <strong>Website instead of app is better suitable here.</strong> </p> 
                        <br><br>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">REFINED EXPERIENCE</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">So from the previous analyze, <strong>the activity fair should still be our focus.</strong> But we could use online platform (app) to optimize their offline experience. So different stages of the refined experience are categorized based on the activity fair, and their targets are:</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/target.png"><br><br><br><br>

            </div>


            <div id="design">
                <h2 class="page-header bT">DESIGN</h2>
                <hr>
                    <p class="project-desc">For the design session, I sticked the key research findings on a whiteboard like current and refined experience and design target (as shown below). I want to make sure all my design aligns with users needs and solve their real problems. </p>
                    <img style = "width:50%" src="assets/img/google/whiteboard.jpeg" data-action="zoom"><br><br>
                    <p class="project-desc">And also from the previous analyze, browsing and searching will mostly happens on the app, while website provide a better proposing experience. In order to make it consistent, design should be provided for both platforms. However because of time constraint, and app covered mainly usage for browsing and searching, I focused on the app design. But a basic version of website was also provided.</p><br><br>
                
                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">SKETCHING</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">So I started sketching! As our target was to utilize app to optimize the activity fair's experience. I started from the pain points of the activity fair and proposing experience, and designed the corresponding features to solve challenges, with keeping in mind the target for each steps.</p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/wireframe.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br><br>


                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">DESIGN ITERATION 1</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Right now the design covers the activity fair experience. But if it mainly designed for the activity fair, although it has other functions like managing all events and organizations, I felt it was hard for students to find the strong motivation to open it later. So students may only use it once. </p>
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">So can we apply this not only for the campus fair but also for daily usage?</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="project-desc"><strong>I looked back to research. One feedback is that 'Most users will join a lot at the beginning but forget to join the events later'.</strong> It inspired me that one step is actually missing here. </p>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/iteration1.png"><br><br>
                    
                    <p class="project-desc">Exploring events can perfectly solve this pain point. Users can explore some events to join. Even some organization that they have not joined yet. So I focused on the <strong>'event'</strong> and made the following refinements:</p><br><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/iteration1_1.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br>

                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/iteration1_3.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br><br>




               <!-- <h3 class="overview_subtitle">NAVIGATION BAR</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">As the main target is activity fair, <strong>one tab 'explore' is specifically designed for the activity fair</strong>, which including let users quickly browse and keep track of interested organizations. <strong>Another tab 'saved' is mainly for managing all organizations.</strong> Apart from this, the most important needs from the research is 'event' information. That's why in the 'saved' tab, users also can manage all events they gonna join.<br></p><br>
                    <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/google/navigation bar1.png" data-action="zoom"><br><br>
                    
                    <p class="project-desc">As organization has 'explore' and 'manage', but for events, it only has 'manage'. It inspires me to think: do we need 'explore event' or not? Actually it is especially useful for the daily usage.
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">So can we apply this not only for the campus fair but also for daily usage?</span>
                    </p>

                    <p class="project-desc"><strong>I looked back to research. One feedback is that 'Most users will join a lot at the beginning but forget to join the events later'.</strong> Exploring events can perfectly solve this pain point. Users can explore some events to join. Even some organization that they have not joined yet. <strong>So it came to the second alternative: design for daily life but it should support the activity fair.</strong>.</p><br>

                    <p class="project-desc">Now we covered all their experiences not only for the activity fair, but also for daily usage. In order to conduct a feedback session to identify potential issues, I drew a complete wireframe with details inside.</p>
