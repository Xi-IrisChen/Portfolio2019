                    <p class="project-desc">​Last summer, I interned at <strong>Tencent</strong> as a UX Designer and was part of the QQ Browser team (QB). <strong>QB has 350 million MAU, the largest among Chinese web browsers.</strong><strong> I was the individual designer on the project, but I was co-mentored by the design lead and a senior UX designer.</strong></p>

                    <h3 class="overview_subtitle">Background</h3>
                        <p class="project-desc">​QB (QQ Web Browser) has diverse user contexts like watching movies, playing games, reading e-books, studying... To tailor for those, QB keeps rolling out new features like video center or reading modes. So there are so many cool features. But the problem is that users don't know that!</p>
                        <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/tencent/challenge1.png"><br><br><br><br>

                        <p class="project-desc">One common solution is that a lot of features will provide notifications to attract users' attention, like notifying users when the newest episode comes. A lot of users complain it's such annoying!</p>
                        <img style = "width:100%" src="assets/img/tencent/challenge2.png"><br><br><br><br>


                        <p class="project-desc"><strong>So our goal is to reduce the distraction of too many notifications and find other ways to increase the discoverability of features.</strong></p><br><br>

                        <p class="project-desc">​A lot of products already provide personalizing news, feeds, or activities, but how about personalizing features? So I initiated an idea of personalizing all features in the web browser based on the user’s profile and contexts of use: </p><br>

So how to determine what contexts to map? Whether more coarse-grained like working, entertainment or fine-grained like reading books, watching movies? To make it simple at this stage, I chose the biggest two contexts and categorized features to working and entertainment contexts.</p>

But before I start, I conducted a quick <strong>data log analysis</strong> to make sure personas represents QB's target users. Data log analysis also helps us to determine our major user context - working: 
                        <!--- Age distribution: 13 - 40.<br>
                        - Usage time distribution: almost same proportion of morning, afternoon, evening.<br>
                        - Target users include middle-aged businessman. And this group always use QB at daily time (working time)</p>--><br><br>

                <hr>
                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">Business Side</h3>
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Balancing between business needs and users’ needs</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-desc">User-centered design. It’s true, but in real-world we need to balance with business needs. Such as from users’ needs, providing less functions can simplify workload and enhance efficiency. But more functions can increase user retention from business target. How to solve this conflict? This is where UX designer is needed to solve the problem and come up with new ideas! With keeping in mind both users’ needs and business target constraints.</p>

                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Incorporate implementation cost and design values into consideration</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-desc">Considering implementation effort is already a natural process during my design process, but what’s more, good designer should try to simplify solution as much as possible, especially under constraints like time or implementation costs. For example, when I redesigned game center, considering the ddl for rapid releasing, instead of incorporating something new at the first version, it’s better to optimize whole flow but use existing widgets at first. And then I also presented the expected widgets to PM for next version’s design.</p>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">Facilitate Process with Communication</h3>
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Closer cooperation with PM</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-desc">Especially when coming up with new ideas, closer cooperate with PM to make sure if the problem exists and is suitable for the target user group. This step is crucial to make sure everyone in the team are on the same page.</p>

                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Asking about feedback can greatly facilitate the whole process</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-desc">Whenever stucked by multiple designs, don't just list pros and cons and try to select one out individually. It’s better to draw different alternatives to get others’ feedback or use A / B testing to get users’ feedback. It will greatly facilitate the iteration process.</p>

                <h3 class="overview_subtitle">What I’m good at:</h3>
                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">Coming up with new ideas</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-desc">During my three months’ internship, I came up with new ideas for three projects. I love brainstorming new ideas using all kinds of technologies! For me, I feel excited to incorporate advanced technology into daily product to provide a little more intelligence and efficiency. </p>

                    <p class="left-vertical-line margin-top-2">
                        <span class="key-word">My strength in technology</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-desc">I really appreciate the opportunity to share my knowledge of AI technologies with others. During my internship, I wrote an article “A designer’s guide to machine learning” and conducted a tech talk for design team about machine learning products, which to some extent enhance a little bit of other designers' understanding and interests in machine learning. Moreover, after this internship, I have more passion for AI products and cannot wait to use my understanding of technologies to create AI products with great user experience!</p>
